# Heaven on Earth

Imagine an ideal world, an utopia, where everything is fair and just. A world where no child is starving. A world where there is peace throughout. A world in which all life forms can co-exist by being mutually benificial. A world where no child is starving. A world where no family is facing what the some families of North Kora, Syria, etc., is facing. A world without Religions and Nations. Where everybody is a citizen of the world. A world where humanity is our religion. A world were our imagination is our only boundary. A world whose culture is made of love, fun, progress & scinece.

What are all the things that we need to accomplish to get there? A 1000 years ago, our ancestors could never have guessed, even in their wildest dreams, that we would get here. Who is to say we can't have our utopia in the next century? I mean, surely, we won't be here by then. But the ones we love, and the ones that they love, will still be here. So why not leave them some guidelines to get there?

This is a just an experiment to see if people are willing to discuss such things. Or am I too naive to think of such things?


## How to get there?

1. Describe the state of the current world.
1. Describe the state of the ideal world in which we all would love to live in.
1. Diff the states and try to identify the transitions that we need to apply.
1. Propose practical transistions (large and small) that we need to apply to our initial state to get to the desired state eventually.

## Do I sound stupid?

If I do, please suggest changes to make it sound less stupid. That way, we can probably get to a state where there is no stupidity involved.
